This AI can analyze an imdb movie review and determine if it is generally positive or negative. It was trained on extensive data and reached a final accuracy of slightly over 86%. The intial accuracy was much lower, but  after augmenting the data and implementing Bidrectional LSTM layers, I was able to raise its final accuracy to the mid-high 80s.
